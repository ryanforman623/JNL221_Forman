			<h3>Syracuse Crime is Still on the Rise</h3>

Violent crime clearance rates have dropped drastically across New York State in the past five years, which reflects a growing challenge for law enforcement agencies today– especially those that are already impacted by staffing shortages, rising caseloads, and a shift in investigative demands. 2024 state-reported policing data shows that 11 New York agencies have experienced declines in their violent-crime solve rates since 2019, which many experts say makes it more difficult for communities to feel confident in the justice system.
.</p>
			<p>The Syracuse Police Department’s numbers are especially noticeable. The department reported 1,111 violent incidents in 2024, one of the highest totals for a city of its magnitude, however, only 27% of those cases were solved. That’s 27% lower than its solve rate in 2019, one of the steepest declines compared to other agencies.</p>

			<p>Syracuse is not the other one facing this issue. Larger departments such as the Nassau County Police Department saw a 37 point drop, and the Onondaga County Sheriff’s Office fell by 25 points. Even New York City, a city with more resources, still saw a small decline. These drops add up to more than 100 percentage points, which makes it clear that this is a statewide issue, not just a local issue.</p>

			<h3>Understanding a Statewide Trend
</h3>
			<p>Criminal justice experts emphasize that there are many different factors that can affect clearance rates– whether witnesses cooperate, how complicated a specific case can be, and how changes in how violent incidents are even defined, to name a few. Even though these factors differ from one agency to the next, the data still shows the overall trend: clearance rates are declining. 
</p>
<p>According to the Center of State Government, Syracuse recorded 765 violent incidents per 100,000 residents, one of the highest rates in the state. Despite this, the department’s clearance rate is substantially lower than other jurisdictions like Albany at 37%, Yonkers at 67%, or Erie County at 82%.</p>

<p>To better understand what happens once a violent crime is reported, Lieutenant Moyles of south Bronx New York explained: </p>
<p> “Patrol units will arrive to begin initial investigation. One unit should interview the complainant or witness whilst other units canvass for perpetrators. Detective Squad will then come to the scene to begin further investigation, including canvassing for video and other evidence. Detectives will then follow through with the investigation until the case is done. ”</p>
<p>Moyles noted that conditions in which officers now operate have changed. Detectives may carry more cases at once, witnesses may be less willing to cooperate, and digital evidence can even introduce delays as it has become increasingly central to building a case. </p>
<p></p>

<h3>A Shift Since 2019
</h3>
<p>The data shows that clearance rates were already on the decline before the COVID-19 pandemic, but many disruptions accelerated that decline between 2020-2022. Many departments have not yet returned to their pre-COVID-19 staffing levels.</p>
<p>Differences in state reporting standards also matter. Agencies don’t all define violent incidents in the same way, and some have even changed their reporting methods. When asked what affects solve rates the most right now, Moyles pointed to the pressures of limited investigative resources.
</p>
<p>"These days, cooperative complaints and clear video footage make the biggest difference in whether we can actually solve a case"</p>
<p>Moyles’ comments support what the statewide numbers show: even though the violent-crime levels have shifted year to year, many departments are struggling to investigate cases as thoroughly and as quickly as they once did</p>

			<h3>How Syracuse Compares to State Trends
</h3>
			<p>Syracuse’s clearance rate might be low on its own, but it becomes even more noticeable when compared to state and national patterns. While some agencies within the state are struggling to solve violent crimes like they did in the past, national data shows almost the opposite trend. According to BBC, its latest report shows that “violent crime fell by an estimated 3% between 2022 and 2022.”</p>
			<p>This contrast highlights the core issue: it’s not that crime is necessarily rising in Syracuse, but solve rates are falling, which means fewer cases are being resolved even as reported crime declines on a nationwide level. 
</p>

			<h3>Limitations of the Data
</h3>
<p>Even though the Center of State government’s dataset gives an overview of how many violent incidents were reported vs. solved, it still doesn’t show the full picture. It doesn’t include any cases that might have been reopened, solved after the reporting period ended, or how many were even reported. Clearance rates can also be heavily influenced by cases where there are exceptions to cases that are technically closed without an arrest, where it can make numbers appear different.
</p>
<p>Data also doesn’t disclose anything about the staffing levels, how the police departments are structured, or what budgets look like– all of which can play a major role in why solve rates have not gone down.
</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, 11 agencies saw noticeable declines, showing that this isn’t just a one-off issue. There are much bigger, structure shifts happening across the state.
