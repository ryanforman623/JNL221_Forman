			<p> <strong> This data is all about the earnings in sports contracts. This data is organized by overall earnings per year and organized by sport. Sports contracts are only going up and it’s interesting to compare from 8 to 10 years ago and just see that contracts have only gone up. My hypothesis would be: if you’re in the BIG 10 conference, than you’re probably getting the biggest bonus.</strong>

			<p> <strong>This data set comes from the Washington Police and Sheriff’s regarding military grade weapons they currently have. This is gathered on an inventory list and is an incredibly long list for the police. This is genuinely concerning because our protectors shouldn’t be carrying massive firearms around town. By giving these officers high grade weapons, more police violence outbreaks will rise up.</strong>
